The frontend for PineStore in Svelte: https://pinestore.cc/ .

Feel free to help out on the development on the site. Come have a chat on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sNhyBjGez5) about bugfixes, possible changes or suggestions!

## Setup
Assuming you already have NodeJS installed, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Now everything should be ready for development. Simply start the development server and any changes made to the source code should show up in your browser. Do so with the following command (which also opens the page in your browser)

```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Documentation
All documentation we have at the moment for all of the communication with the backend API is at [https://pinestore.cc/documentation](https://pinestore.cc/documentation).
